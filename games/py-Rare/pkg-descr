Rare is a graphical interface for Legendary, a command line
alternative to Epic Games launcher, based on PyQt5

Why Rare?
- Runs natively, and supports most of the major platforms
- Gets out of your way when you don't need it, allowing you to enjoy your
games
- Tries to be as lightweight as we can make it while still
offering a feature-full experience
- Integrates seamlessly with legendary as both projects are developed in
Python
- Packages, packages everywhere
