# freebsd-legendary-port
Welcome! This is where I store the files for the legendary-gl and Rare ports (and test changes on them as well.)

Both are production-ready and thoroughly tested, so you may use them from here if you'd like.

STATUS:<br>
py-legendary-gl: [not merged](https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=272565)<br>
py-Rare: still needs a bit more fine graining, not published to the bugzilla yet.
